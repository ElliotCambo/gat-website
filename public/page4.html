			The GAT tokens Mission is singular. The world of tomorrow will present many challenges for which our existing structures of governance and macro economic management, are not optimally equipped to deal with. The risks in not researching additional means by which our global economic system could be managed may give rise to social discord and increasing inequality.
<br><br> The mission of this project is to explore ways of harnessing technology, to provide new governance structures that are targeted at providing solutions to these underlying issues (a high-level summary of which follows). <br><br> It is the overarching ambition of this project to provide a basis upon which further research can be conducted, in the field of social innovation and development studies. With an ultimate objective to define a blueprint for national governments, outlining how the technical  solutions defined could be used to future proof our economic system, to reduce inequality, and to restore faith in institutions. <br><br>


			<strong>Overview</strong><br>
			The below section talks at a high-level about a number of challenges many of which have been documented by academics in the field. For a more in-depth understanding of some of the topics discussed, please refer to the blog section. The purpose of the following is to provide as comprehensive an outline of four underlying challenges (we promote) our generation faces, and the risks associated with not providing a glide path to resolution.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The <strong>global asset token</strong> has been commissioned to find solutions to the following four problems :</span><br></p><p>1) The rise of technology, replacing workers with automated systems and processes.</p><p>2) A lack of global leadership on monitary policy, leading to a precipitous rise in the use of debt to fund government expenditures.</p><p>3) The rise of inequality, and the resulting social dissonance.</p><p>4) The nature of Legacy institutions, that were not built for the time of globalisation.<br>Taking each point in turn<br><br></p><p><strong>The rise of technology, replacing workers with automated systems and processes.</strong></p><p>Technology has delivered unparalleled progress for humankind. It is optimised and alleviated humans from much of the frustration and angst associated with performing tasks repetitively. These gains initially solved mechanical limitations, allowing for the manufacture of goods at a mass-market scale. From here technology evolved, with the advent of the transistor and the personal computer revolution, to ultimately define a completely new way of working, which could largely be touted as responsible for the growth of the middle class, and the service sector as a whole.</p><p>
Internet enabled technologies have delivered us to the present day. We are able to collaborate and communicate far more effectively than any other generation in our history. Notwithstanding, that the rise of technology has, in its wake, taken many jobs, work that was historically done by hundreds of people, is now achieved with ever increasing levels of efficiency by automated processes, leveraging increasingly less human resource.</p><p>
The trajectory of technology, has always been to alleviate our requirements to expel energy, whether that be physical or mental. This is concomitant with the underlying pursuit shared by all living things to expel as little energy as possible, to survive and thrive.</p><p>
We have created technology with the sole purpose of furthering this initiative, and with the promises of future development, technology may ultimately lead to a fundamental shift in the value of humanity.
Many commentators have already remarked on the role we as a species will play when we reach a juncture, in the not too distant future, where the line share of value adding activities, can be performed through computerised means. The GAT project is a proponent of the idea that the rise of technology must be offset by policy, specifically targeted to ensuring that with technological advances, democratisation of that technology is also assured.</p><p>
Without having these safeguards in place in advance of this advent, we may face a level of economic, political, and social unrest, that may be unparalleled in our history. For the first time in our existence, there will be an existential threat posed to our relevance as a species, and for this eventuality to have been entirely self-imposed.</p><p>

	<br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>A lack of global leadership on monitary policy, leading to a precipitous rise in the use of debt to fund government expenditures.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Debt forms the basis for economic growth. Without the ability to create debt/credit, the pace of economic development and with it the growth of living standards is slowed significantly. Debt, has been used as a mechanism, to grow productivity, invest in infrastructure, and tackle global crises.</p><p> 
However, the last hundred years has seen a significant rise in the use of debt, to not only resolve market failures, and world wars, but more as a means to sustain growth and government expenditures on services for the general public. This in short means, that governments, fearful of introducing higher tax legislation, are prepared to award additional IOUs, as the most politically expedient way to ensure the support of the electorate. </p><p>
It may be said that this is a worryingly convergent trend, as, viewed at a higher level, across nations around the world, this tendency gives rise to an increased readiness to issue debt to alleviate short-term political challenges. This, we can disproportionately see is most visible in developed economies, where as a means to stimulate growth, and to ensure living standards tangibly improve, more debt is required to assuage citizens of their expectations. </p><p>

From a markets perspective, the advent of fractional reserve banking, has significantly outsourced monetary policy to the banking sector. This has given power to banking institutions to create credit while holding only a fraction of the value in cash reserves.</p><p>
It may be argued that this represents a systematic failure of our monetary system, as this approach will continue to work, up until the debt is too great to be serviced, or as has previously been observed, confidence in an economy wanes, and as a result, the central bank must intervene to backstop cash requirements.</p><p>

Coupled to this, some of the largest gainers from this increase in liquidity, and the overall efficiency of capital markets, have been individuals and institutions that have been most readily placed to take advantage of this glut.
With interest rates in developed economies remaining near zero, the price of borrowing, for those that can, has never been cheaper, and with that enhanced buying power, individuals with the access to the credit available (on an institutional level) have been able to invest and grow, heightening profits, and affording significant returns for those best placed to take advantage.</p><p>

The scenario that could arise if borrowing is not managed at a global level, may see an increasing gap between those that have access to credit, who can intern grow fortunes for themselves, and those that do not. 
Hence, a sound and robust system that insures debt is used prudently along with access to it, is one of the largest, and most effective safeguards we have to ensure equality can be managed in the years ahead.</p><p>

With that being said there are two primary challenges with making amendments to our existing system. The first is the difficulties in making a transition towards a more sustainable model, while the existing system is in place. And secondly, monetary policy orchestrated at the national level provides fine grain control of the local economic environment, the drawbacks of not having tools to manage monetary policy at this level were lane bare in the difficulties the European Union faced in handling the financial crisis of 2008. Solutions to these challenges are outlined in the subsequent section.</p><p> 

<br></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The rise in inequality, and an increase in social dissonance.</strong><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">For centuries, there has always been those that have tangibly more than others. This is in and of itself not an unfair, nor and just phenomenon. Individuals, with conviction and drive bring forth inventions, products, and ideas into the world, for which we all benefit. The individuals that are responsible for these creations, shape our daily lives, and to that end, for good or for bad, these inventions, ideas, and concepts, make the world what it is today.</p><p>
It should also be noted that at the core of every successful product, lies a human want, or desire, products are created to cater for these wants and desires, and the best implementations of those products, are those that we trust. This trust, rightfully commands loyalty, and through that loyalty fortunes are established, the proceeds of which, head back into the economy, from wages to taxation.</p><p> 
However, there is strong evidence that the world is not set up quite as equitably as this. Individuals and corporations have a myriad of mechanisms at their disposal to ensure that the proceeds of their product or service, are retained, and as little as possible is ultimately afforded as fiscal income.</p><p>
It would be very easy to assume that this practice, that leverages mechanisms (such as tax havens), have been used out of malice, out of a disregard for other citizens, and a desire not to contribute to society. The reality is that companies at the scale of household brands, are competing against companies based in other jurisdictions who all have a desire to remain competitive, to increase their market share, and grow. If a company, or institution can immediately add a percentage of profits, as revenue, as opposed to a tax liability, then in the interests of ensuring their position in the market is maintained, companies have little choice but to take advantage of these mechanisms to ensure their long-term survival.
In addition to this governments around the world are reluctant to intervene as they are all too aware, that if they insured that companies registered within their jurisdiction, payed tax at an appropriate level, those businesses would lose out on the international stage, let alone risk those companies moving overseas.</p><p>
The net effect of this reality, is that individuals at the tops of multinational corporations, as well as individuals and firms who make investments using funds based in tax havens, coupled with access to credit and the power of technology, all contribute to an increasing disparity between those at the bottom/middle, and the top.</p><p>
As we have documented in other articles, we have never experienced wealth distribution as unequal as we do today, and without direct intervention, at the global level, we may not be able to bring about, a more just, equal, and prosperous global society.</p><p> <br>



	<strong>The nature of legacy institutions, that are ill-equipped to adjust at a sufficient rate for the time of globalisation.</strong></p><p>National governments, and organisations that support national governments (central banks) were created at a time well before the present day. The mandates of these institutions have evolved hugely, as global trade, connectivity, and the rise of technology has expanded their remit, to not simply manage an economy, but rather to manage an economy within the context of other economies.</p><p>
Institutions have evolved to meet this obligation, and many have been set up as mechanisms to share learning, ideas and formulate policy. These institutions also, on the national level are imbued with a nations identity. They are the keepers and the perpetuators of a large proportion of the national conscience. </p><p>
However in the globally connected world we now live in coupled with the increasing cross pollination of cultural ideas, it may be said that this mode of managing society, and the economy as a whole, leads to inefficiencies and inequalities. Some of which have already been outlined in our discussions of debt, and the challenging landscape nations operat in, with respect to fiscal policy, and their understandable reluctance in many cases to prevent use of tax havens.</p><p>
At their core, the challenges facing institutions are that in the fast changing world we now live in, the rate of change the electorate expects from institutions is greater than that which they can consistently deliver. This either infers that the efficiency of our institutions must improve, making them faster to react to change or, there must be an underlying adjustment in the landscape upon which institutions are built. This new landscape must allow citizens to buy into a reality which, while cannot be void of inequality, the belief that the systems ground rules demand that equality is the variable to maximise, as opposed to rather than pure economic performance.</p><p>
	
	<br></p><p><strong>The future</strong></p><p>With these points in consideration, a truly global structure could be created (outlined below) that allows for a more equitable financial system to be sustained. This above all else, can ensure greater transparency, and uniformity in the approaches taken toward economic management, which in turn will provide a more credible basis for the governance process to be undertaken, restoring trust in institutions, and breeding greater prosperity for the collective.</p><p>
It is the objective of The global asset token to provide a glide path from the present day towards this future.</p></div>

The GAT crypto currency at a high-level, seeks to address these challenges by creating an asset that responds directly to the challenges outlined above.</p><p>

At a high-level, the main difference between GAT and a currency (like the dollar) lies in the fact that the GAT asset combines aspects of legislation responsible for wealth redistribution (furthering global equality) as well as representing a store of value. In short it is intelligent money.</p><p>

Hence a token once minted can be exchanged between peers, and a small amount of the transaction cost is provided as fiscal income to the system. The protocol then mandates that proceeds from transactions are distributed amongst registered organisations who can then in turn use this liquidity to provide the services that citizens require.</p><p>

Individuals identify by consensus organisations that provide these services (municipal functions), and the financial records of how proceeds from fiscal income are spent are made publicly available via the GAT blockchain. </p><p>

In addition, a portion of proceeds of fiscal income are delivered to organisations around the world whose citizens live in a different jurisdiction that hold proportionately less GAT than that of others (in developed economies). This in the long run will ensure wealth distribution is managed systematically, as well as encouraging investment within developing economies as a result of ensured increases in the spending power of their citizens. </p><p>

GAT also allows for the creation of private organisations (companies) to which users (citizens) can be affiliated, thereby providing, amongst other benifits, a definitive record globally of employment. This facilitates more efficient and direct use of benifits, and allows for citizens whos industry may be in decline as a result of technology to be legible for GAT dividend payments, carving a path to a glabl living wage.</p><p>

With this as a pre-face covering the overall architecture of GAT (more detail is available in the grey paper link below) we will now cover off some of the core concepts of the currency in more specific terms.</p><p>

<strong>The GAT token</strong>
</span><br></p><p>The GAT crypto currency at a high-level, seeks to address these challenges by creating an asset that responds directly to the challenges outlined above.</p><p>An individual unit of currency is imbued with the following characteristics.<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p><p>- A means of storing value,</p><p>- A means of capturing fiscal income,<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p><p>We will look to address each of these intern, however initially we will define the mining process of GAT and the rationalisation of the approach taken.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mining</strong></p><p>The minting of new units of currency (of any denomination) begins with the Minter acquiring a public private key pair from the GAT organisation. This key pair, is used to sign all units of currency created. <br><br>All distributed keys are baked into all official clients (the GAT Mobile Wallet for example) such that tokens received (units of currency) can be validated by a user for authenticity. While there are no limits to the amount of credit created as part of any distinct mining process, the GAT Organisation ultimately has the authority to recognise, or otherwise prevent circulation of coins/tokens minted from a particular key pair. <br><br>All units of currency are imbued with a minting batch ID, dependent on the batch ID, particular units of currency can be created for use only in the facilitation of specific types of transaction. For example a coin/token could be created that would permit its owner to exchange a given value of GAT (or another currency denomination) for only a particular good or service. In context this could be the creation of credit/debt for students to use to support college and university financing.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><strong>The GAT Wallet</strong></p><p>The Wallet hosts one or more accounts. An individual may have multiple accounts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The GAT Account (Wallet)</strong></p><p>The GAT account represents the following capabilities.</p><p>- A form of identity</p><p>- A store of GAT&nbsp;</p><p>And in future ...</p><p>- A pension (prtected account)</p><p>- A means of receiving dividends </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Drawing on credit</strong></p><p>Credit can be withdrawn from the subsystem through an intermediary. This represents the largest area of research and development for the GAT project, as ideally we would define a mechanism by which individuals could offer themselves credit, that they would be bound to repay at a later date. </p><p>However in keeping with current modes and practices, a regulated intermediary such as a bank would provide the service of vetting individuals, assessing their credit worthiness, and ultimately apportioning funds to individuals and organisations.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p><p><strong>Capturing and distributing fiscal income</strong></p><p>Fiscal income is captured as people transact. Much like VAT, or the so-called Tobin tax, small portions of all financial transactions are committed to the fiscal subsystem, that are then assigned to local municipal functions who are themselves registered GAT organisations. We will explore organisations in much more detail in a subsequent section.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Pensions</strong></p><p>An equal portion of transaction values are assigned to a protected account (also part of an individuals GAT Account) that can only be drawn down upon when an individual reaches retirement age, or elects to take early retirement. In the event of early retirement a proportional deduction in the value of their pension holdings will be re-distributed amongst other protected accounts.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Dividends</strong></p><p>Dividends are received by individuals based on the relative increase, or decline in the number of individuals (GAT organisations) that operate in the sector an individual is employed (and paid) within. The fewer the number of individuals employed in a sector relative to historical levels, the greater the dividend payment.</p><p>This should counter the demise of industries that are evaporated as a result of technological advance. The rationale for attributing the word dividend to this source of income (to a GAT account) implys the fact that individuals, by virtue of their participation in an industry in decline shall receive the equivalent of a dividend payment from organisations who have supplanted their place in the market.</p><p>To that end, in an ultimate endgame scenario would give rise to a reality where relatively few individuals are employed, and a semblance of an international basic income is afforded through this dividend payment scheme. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>GAT Organisations and Identities</strong></p><p>Individuals have an authenticated GAT id that, for the purposes of this document, can be understood as a passport. In future and individuals GAT id will reflect identifying information, such as name and age, as well as biometric data that can be leveraged by other organisations (with the individuals consent) to provide more effective services such as health care and law-enforcement. This identity will reside on a user's phone, and is secured by public private key cryptography.</p><p>Organisations can take a number of forms, determined by their purpose. The following are a list of types of organisation that can be created by an individual on the GAT Organisations subsystem.</p><p>- A business.</p><p>- A municipal oversight body (and agglomeration of municipal organisations).</p><p>- A municipal function.</p><p>All organisations are created with respect to a geographic locale, and it is to these organisations that individuals can be bound to as employees. All organisations have a defined sector of business operation, as well as (depending on their type) and ownership structure, links individuals to share holder representation in an organisation. </p><p>Organisations that are in the public interest, such as municipal functions are assigned this title by consensus. For example individuals, via the GAT mobile app are able to identify, from a list of the municipal functions that provide services in their local area. Organisations can mark themselves to appear on this list in a given geographic locale, and by consensus, individuals authenticate a given organisation to perform a particular municipal function in the local area, or, in the case of a municipal oversight body, at the national level.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also an area of research and development for the GAT organisation, as we ultimately need a means of ensuring that legitimate municipal functions are represented on the GAT organisations subsystem, and bad actors are rejected.</p><p>Organisations established as a municipal function cannot earn income directly to their GAT Account, rather they are funded by proceeds from the GAT fiscal subsystem. And example of this would be healthcare, individuals fiscal revenue is distributed amongst healthcare trusts in the users locale. Municipal oversight bodies can ultimately re-appropriate funds from one municipal function to another subject to requirements, however this reallocation can only occur between municipal organisations that deliver the same services (this may be subject to change).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional detail on the implementation of the above can be found in the white paper below</strong></p></div>
